Event aggregation and planning platform focused on bollywood dance workshops

## Problem

The bollywood dance workshop scene in the US is fairly large and growing both with 
NRIs (Non-resident Indians) and Americans with the growth in popularity of bollywood. 

With that many different dancers have been offerring popup dance workshops and classes
as they travel across the country. However, the space is not the most accessible as there
isn't a good way to learn about classes or teachers without knowing someone in the community already.

## Solution

A platform that can firstly aggregate events from select dancers and coordinate bookings.

### Milestones

* Aggregate events from select dancers and let users view and filter the data
* Let teachers schedule events through the platform and handle payment directly
